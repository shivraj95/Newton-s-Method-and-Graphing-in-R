# Newton-s-Method-and-Graphing-in-R
In this repository, I use Newton's Method to optimize a generic function. Further, I created a function that parses through a text file and
outputs the most frequent words and their respective word count. Lastly, I use ggplot to create a detailed graph where the fluctuation 
in the dataset is minimized.
